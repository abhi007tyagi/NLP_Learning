Akshay Kumar's brand of comedy seems completely out of sync with Farah's brand of humor and the result is a disaster only made tolerable if you are salivating over Katrina Kaif grooving to 'Sheila Ki Jawani' or seeing Akshay and Salman dance together. The script is pretty nonsensical and a stretch even by outrageous plot standards (a conman making a fake movie and convincing a big Bollywood star that it will win an Oscar? Seriously, give me a break!!) and the jokes are pretty weak all through. Tees Maar Khan, for lack of a worser word, is utter trash!"))
